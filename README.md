# TG-whitepaper

## Statement:

## This whitepaper is organized by TGnetwork community enthusiasts based on the official website of TGnetwork. For details, visit the official website tg.network.


We hope that the future world can become a distributed intelligent and distributed feedback world. This world is free, equal and open, and every participating user is the new world protagonist. 

Participate in co-construction and gain the benefits and feedback that the world should have.

In the existing Internet Protocol, the spirit of the Internet—freedom, openness, equality, and sharing— was not well implemented. 

The current Internet world is monopolized by giants, and users participate in it like a white rabbit. Although the centralized world brings some efficiency improvements to users, it will cause a lot of problems. At the same time, because of the existence of firewalls, connectivity cannot be achieved globally.

With the development and maturity of 5G technology, we hope that TGnetwork will play an important role in the next wave of technology. In this decentralized network protocol, everyone is completely fair. Not only can you enjoy the convenience of the latest technology to bring life, but also have the autonomy.

Our team members hope to bring new hope to the world. TGnetwork uses 5G technology as its lowest- level facility, while selecting technologies that will serve humanity in the coming decades—blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. As the underlying network of this new world, we hope that 3.6 billion Internet users worldwide will be able to use the Internet through our network protocols, and everyone in the new world will have the same status without a central server.

TGnetwork is a global network protocol under construction. We invite every user who wants to be fair in the Internet world to participate in the joint construction. Together, we will build a healthy and fair foundation.
